.SH NAME
nc6 \- network swiss army knife
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nc6
.I "[options...] hostname port"
.br
.B nc6
.I "-l -p port [-s addr] [options...] [hostname] [port]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B netcat6
is a simple unix utility which reads and writes data across network
connections, using the TCP or UDP protocol over IPv4 or IPv6 networks.
It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or
easily driven by other programs and scripts.  At the same time, it is a
feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create
almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting
built-in capabilities. 
.B netcat6
, or
.B nc6
as the actual program is named, should have been supplied long ago
as another one of those cryptic but standard Unix tools.
.P
In the simplest usage, "
.B nc6 host port
" creates a TCP connection to the
given port on the given target host.  Your standard input is then sent
to the host, and anything that comes back across the connection is
sent to your standard output.  This continues indefinitely, until the
network side of the connection shuts down.  Note that this behavior is
different from most other applications which shut everything down and
exit after an end-of-file on the standard input (though this style of
operation can easily be enabled).
.P
netcat6 can also function as a server, by listening for inbound connections on
arbitrary ports and then doing the same reading and writing.  With minor
limitations, netcat6 doesn't really care if it runs in "client" or "server"
mode -- it still shovels data back and forth until there isn't any more left.
In this manual page, these two working modes are referred as "connect mode"
and "listen mode", respectively.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 13
.I \-4
Forces the use of IPv4. 
.TP 13
.I \-6
Forces the use of IPv6 and inhibits the use IPV4-mapped addresses.
.TP 13
.I \-h, --help
Display a brief help listing.
.TP 13
.I \-l, --listen
Selects listen mode (for inbound connects).
.TP 13
.I \-n
Disables DNS queries - you'll have to use numeric IP address 
instead of hostnames.
.TP 13
.I \-p, --port=PORT
Sets the port number for the local endpoint of the connection.
.TP 13
.I \-q, --hold-timeout=SEC1[:SEC2]
Sets the hold timeout(s) (see "TIMEOUTS").  Specifying just one value
will set the hold timeout on the local endpoint, specifying a second value will
set the hold timeout on the remote endpoint as well.  Either value can be '0'
(for instant timeout) or '-' (for no hold timeout, eg. infinite hold).
.TP 13
.I \-s, --address=ADDRESS
Sets the source address for the local endpoint of the connection.
.TP 13
.I \-u, --udp
With this option set, netcat6 will use UDP as the transport protocol (TCP is
the default).
.TP 13
.I \-v
Enable verbose mode.  This gives some basic information about what netcat6
is doing.  Use it twice for extra verbosity.
.TP 13
.I \-w, --timeout=SECONDS
Timeout for network connects and accepts.
.TP 13
.I \-x, --transfer
File transfer mode (see "FILE TRANSFER").  If listen mode is
specified, this is equivalent to "--recv-only --buffer-size=65536" otherwise
it is equivalent to "--send-only --buffer-size=65536".
.TP 13
.I \--recv-only
Only receive data, don't transmit.  This also disables any hold timeouts.
.TP 13
.I \--send-only
Only send data, don't receive.  This also disables any hold timeouts.
.TP 13
.I \--buffer-size=BYTES
Set the buffer size for the local and remote endpoints.
netcat6 does all reads into these buffers, so they should be large enough
to minimize excessive reads from the socket and in UDP mode it should be large
enough to receive an entire datagram (also see '--nru').  By default, the
buffer size is 8192 bytes for TCP connections and 65536 bytes for UDP.
.TP 13
.I \--mtu=BYTES
Set the Maximum Transmission Unit for the remote endpoint (network transmits).
This is only really useful for datagram protocols like UDP.  For TCP the MTU
is determined by the kernel and this will only affect the amount that is
passed to the kernel at any one time.  There is no default MTU for TCP
connections (and there should be no need to change this), and for UDP it is
8192 bytes.
.TP 13
.I \--nru=BYTES
Set the miNimum Receive Unit for the remote endpoint (network receives).  Note
that this does not mean that every network read will get the specified number
of bytes, only that nc6 MUST be able to receive at least that amount of data
when a read is done.  This is only really useful for datagram protocols like
UDP where the entire datagram must be received in one call or it is truncated.
The default NRU for TCP connections is 1 byte, and 65536 bytes for UDP.
.TP 13
.I \--half-close
Properly handle (and send) TCP half closes for protocols that support them
(eg. TCP).
.TP 13
.I \--disable-nagle
Disable the use of the Nagle algorithm for TCP connections (see "NAGLE
ALGORITHM").
.TP 13
.I \--no-reuseaddr
Disables the SO_REUSEADDR socket option (this is only useful in listen mode).
.SH UDP
UDP support in netcat6 works very well in both connect and in listen mode.
When using UDP in listen mode netcat6 accepts UDP packets from any source that
matches the optional address and/or port specified (if it was specified).
However, once the first packet is received, netcat6 will only receive packets from that client in future.  This is done by putting the UDP socket into "connected" state (see udp(4) and connect(2)).  Packets from other sources are discarded by the kernel and an ICMP unreachable response is sent.
.P
When connecting to a remote host using UDP, nc6 will report that the
connection is open regardless of whether a remote server is listening.  This
is because UDP is a connectionless protocol, and hence no connection
establishment is actually required.  However, after sending the first packet
of data, a server may reply with an ICMP unreachable response causing nc6 to
exit with a 'Connection refused' error message.
.P
netcat6 allows for fine control over the buffer sizes, MTU's and NRU's for the
connection, which is especially useful for UDP connections.  See the
--buffer-size, --mtu and --nru options.
.SH TIMEOUTS
netcat6 currently implements a connect/accept timeout, and hold timeouts on
both the remote and local endpoints.
.IP \(bu 4
The connect/accept timeout is optional and is specified with the -w or
--timeout option.  If a connection cannot be established within the specified
time, nc6 will exit with a non-zero exit status.  If the option is not
specified, nc6 will wait forever when listening for new connections
(in listen mode), and will use the standard operating system timeout when
trying to connect to remote systems.  Note that the connect timeout is
essentially ignored when creating UDP connections to a remote server, as UDP
is a connectionless protocol.
.IP \(bu 4
The hold timeouts specify how long the connection should be held open after a
given endpoint can no longer be read from (because EOF was received).  When
the hold timeout occurs for a given endpoint, no more data is read from the
opposite endpoint.  After data read from the timed out endpoint has been sent,
then the connection is closed and nc6 exits.
.P
For example, setting the hold time of the local endpoint to 5 would cause
reading from the remote system to stop 5 seconds after stdin is closed (eg. by
using ^D to send EOF).  All buffered data to be sent to the remote system is
then sent, after which nc6 exits successfully (if no errors occured).
.P
By default, the hold timeout is disabled for the local endpoint (essentially
an 'infinite' timeout), and the hold timeout is set to 0 for the remote
endpoint (an 'instant' timeout).  This means that nc6 effectively exits 
immediately when the read from the remote server is closed (also see "HALF
CLOSE").
.SH FILE TRANSFER
netcat6 can be used to transfer files and data streams efficiently, using the
\'-x' or '--transfer' command line option.
.P
For example, to transfer a file from machine 'foo.example.com' to machine
\'bar.example.com', one would use the following technique.
.P
On 'foo', set up a listening nc6 on any local port:
.RS

foo$ nc6 -x -l -p 7676 > targetfile

.RE
Then on 'bar', use nc6 to send the file to the listening nc6:
.RS

bar$ nc6 -x foo.example.com 7676 < sourcefile

.RE
You can also use file transfer mode to pipe the output of programs over
networks.  For example, you can use tar with nc6 to copy entire directories:
.RS

foo$ nc6 -x -l -p 7676 | tar xpzf -

bar$ tar cpzf - /home | nc6 -x foo.example.com 7676

.RE
The '-x' or '--transfer' option is just an alias for various other options
which set the direction of transfer and increase the buffer sizes used.  In
listen mode, it is equivalent to "--recv-only --buffer-size=65536" otherwise
it is equivalent to "--send-only --buffer-size=65536".
.P
File transfer mode assumes the file will be sent TO the netcat6 process that
is in listen mode, FROM the netcat6 process that is connecting to it.  It
won't work the other way around, but you can make it do so by specifying the
equivalent options instead of using '-x'.
.SH HALF CLOSE
Stream based data transfers, such as TCP, have 2 separate streams - the
receive and the transmit stream (pretty obvious).  Contrary to common belief,
the streams can be closed independently of each other - in TCP this is called
a half-close.
.P
In standard mode, netcat6 closes the entire remote connection when it detects
that the remote receive stream has been closed.  This is a common operation
for most TCP applications, because it is unusual that a server will keep
accepting data after it has indicated that it will no longer send any.
netcat6 also doesn't close it's remote transmit when it has no more data to
send (eg.  when EOF has been received on stdin), so as not to confuse remote
servers.
.P
However, some servers do make active use of TCP half-closes, and the default
operation of netcat6 doesn't work well with these services.  For example, when
using netcat6 to simulate a HTTP server, some HTTP clients close their
transmit stream after they send their request.  In default mode, netcat6 will
close the entire connection before sending the response back to the client.
.P
However, by specifying the "--half-close" option, netcat6 will keep trying to
send data to the remote server after the receive stream has closed.  It will
also close the remote transmit stream when there is no more data to send.
.SH NAGLE ALGORITHM
Named after its creator, John Nagle, the Nagle algorithm is used to combine
together small writes to a TCP stream and thus decrease the number of packets
that must be sent out on the network.
.P
This was designed as a means for dealing with what Nagle called the small
packet problem, created when an application generates data one byte at a time,
causing the network to be overloaded with packets.  A single character
originating from a keyboard could result in the an entire packet (the single
byte plus packet headers) being sent onto the network.
.P
The algorithm can, under some situations, add a small delay before the data is
sent out on the wire - so as to allow for this concatination to occur.  This
is done in such a way that it is generally unnoticeable for normal
applications, including interactive applications.
.P
There are some situations, such as real-time protocols, that can be adversely
affected by this small delay, which is why it is possible to disable the Nagle
algorithm on most systems, using the TCP_NODELAY socket option.
.P
.B netcat6
provides the '--disable-nagle' command line option to disable the Nagle
algorithm for the connection.
.SH ERRORS
.B netcat6
attempts to exit cleanly (exit value 0) when all data was sent or received
successfully, and to exit with an error value otherwise.  However, the
specific definition of successfully varies depending on the way nc6 is run.
.P
In normal mode, nc6 exits successfully when all data from the remote machine
has been received (up to and including an EOF), and the data has been output
to the stdout without any errors.  It DOES NOT indicate whether all data read
from stdin has been successfully sent to the remote machine.
.P
In --half-close mode, nc6 exists successfully when an EOF has been received
from both the remote machine AND from stdin, and all data has been
successfully sent.  Thus the exit status indicates that all data was
transfered successfully.
.P
If hold timeouts (see "TIMEOUTS") have been set for either the remote or local
endpoint, nc6 will exit successfully if all buffered data from the endpoint
that timed out is succesfully sent.  It DOES NOT indicate whether all data
from the opposite endpoint was sent (or even read).
.P
For connectionless protocols like UDP there is no way of determining whether
the remote system has stopped sending data, or if it will accept further data
sent.  So in UDP mode, nc6 will either never exit (until interrupted via
ctrl-C) or will exit after an error when sending data to the remote system, in
which case the exit code is a failure (exit value 1).
